This is a static html page containing all the release notes. The GitHub Page is automatically deployed and updated through this [link](https://ebi-gene-expression-group.github.io/atlas-release-notes/).

## Post new release notes
Curators need to upload a Markdown file with the name formatted as *Year-Month-Day-Note* under the `_posts` directory.
If an image is included, please refer to the post [`2015-03-20-note.md`](https://github.com/ebi-gene-expression-group/atlas-release-notes/blob/master/_posts/2015-03-20-note.md) and upload the image to the `assets/img/` directory.
