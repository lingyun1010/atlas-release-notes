#### Data statistics

- Ensembl **78** / Ensembl Genomes **24** gene annotations and array design probe set mappings.
                
- This release contains **873** datasets, including **50** RNA-seq experiments. **23** ofthese report [baseline](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/baseline/experiments) gene expression, across a total of **16** different organisms. **850** datasets study samples in **2,121** [differential](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/help/index.html#differential-expression) comparisons across **20** different organisms.
                
- Please note that splice variant expression quantification is no longer available in Atlas. We have also replaced [Cufflinks2](http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/cufflinks/) with [HTSeq](http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.html) for gene expression quantification.
                
- By clicking on the link highlighted on the image below, the experiment data can now by filtered by gene/protein keywords that were mined from the supporting publication by [Europe PubMed Central](http://europepmc.org/).
